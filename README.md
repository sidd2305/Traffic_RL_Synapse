## An intelligent traffic RL system to ensure lesser waiting times and smarter city signals.
We have coded three things-
1-A sumo simulation of q learning algorithm.
2-A pygame solution of round robin approach with priority given to ambulances and emergency vehicles
.3-Heatmap visualization of traffic at a signal along with optimizing policy for speed and volume of traffic
